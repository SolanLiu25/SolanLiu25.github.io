I am a first-year PhD candidate in Computer Vision Group, Informatics Institute, University of Amsterdam under the supervision of [Dr. Shaodi You](https://youshaodi.github.io/) and [Prof. dr. Theo Gevers](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/th.gevers/). My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning, particularly image enhancement and understanding, including image fusion and detection.

Before that, I got my Bacholar's and Master's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Techonology in 2020 and Wuhan University of Techonology in 2017 respectively. During my master, I carried out research on object detection, supervised by Prof. Sheng Zhong. And I used to work in United Imaging Intelligence and Xuanyuan Drive company after graduation.
